# RL_Lab: NPG
The code is based on the paper `TODO: paper`  . <br>
## Installation
* Write the platform name you want to test to `env_name` in `main.py`.<br>
* Setup numbers of iterations `num_iters` in `main.py`.<br>
* Setup `deltas` and `traj_samples_list` in `main.py`.<br>
## Content

* `evaluate.py` a class for evaluating a learned policy. <br>
* `linear_policy` represents a linear policy, which is described in https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.02660.pdf . <br>
* `mlp_value_function.py` represents a neural network with three layers and an approximated value function.<br>
* `npg.py` represents the NPG algorithm. <br>
